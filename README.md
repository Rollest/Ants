# Ants
#The goal of this project was to simulate colonies of ants trying to collect enough food before drought. Every colony have queen, larvas, workers, warriors and special ants. Every day before drought ants from all colonies send all their ants, except the queens, to the arena to collect resources and fight ants from other colonies.
